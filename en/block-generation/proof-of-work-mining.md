# Proof-of-Work block generation

Emercoin is now <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">merge-mined</a> with
Bitcoin using the same SHA-256 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW)
algorithm. Merge-mining enhances Emercoin's blockchain [security model](/en/introduction/security-principles.md) as Emercoin can benefit from mining
power directed to the Bitcoin network. Any miner that mines Bitcoin can now also mine Emercoin as well, for little overhead.
